Volume Weighted Average Price Optimal Execution

Code and examples for the paper on [Volume weighted average price optimal execution](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/vwap_opt_exec.pdf)
by E. Busseti and S. Boyd (2015).

**Note.** The code has not been run or tested since the draft version of the paper has been out
(*i.e.*, summer 2015), so some libraries might have changed APIs. I don't guarantee
that the code now runs as-is.
